The second is the body of our HTTP request, which our endpoint will receive in \"req.body\". Notice that it has to be a string, so we call JSON.stringify to turn our object \"{ x: 1 }\" into a string. We then pass in a header which tells the server that it will be received json data (which is what \"application/json\" specifies). If you copy+paste that into the Javascript console and run it, in the server logs you should see the value of \"req.body\" for the \"/hi\" endpoint, \"{ x: 1 }\".
