The Javascript functions ARE the components, which means you can include one inside of another. If you look at the function App, it returns something that looks like HTML code. There are some elements with capital letters (Box, TitleBar, CoolButton, Button), and some elements without capital letters (div, p). The capital letters tell you that the element is a React Component, and the elements that are just lowercase are builtin html elements (this isn't always true, it's just convention).

It'll take a couple of hours just to get one thing in at the beginning, but you'll get better slowly through experience. If you ever want to get on a call and have me walk you through stuff, I'd be happy to. Good luck!"
